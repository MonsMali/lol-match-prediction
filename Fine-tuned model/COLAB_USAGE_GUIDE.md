## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Files not found in Google Drive"
- Ensure files are uploaded to exact path: `/content/gdrive/MyDrive/Tese/`
- Check file names match exactly

#### "GPU training failed"
- Normal behavior - code automatically falls back to CPU
- Performance difference is minimal for this dataset size

#### "Import errors"
- Re-run Cell 1 if packages failed to install
- Restart runtime if persistent issues

### Performance Expectations
