## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

#### **File Upload Problems:**
```python
# If upload fails, try one file at a time
from google.colab import files
files.upload()  # Upload each file separately
```

#### **Memory Issues:**
```python
# If you get memory errors, reduce Bayesian trials
# Edit the script to change:
self.bayesian_trials = 50  # Reduced from 100
```

#### **Training Too Slow:**
```python
# For faster training (lower performance):
predictor, results = main_enhanced(use_bayesian=False, save_models=True)
```

### **Performance Monitoring:**
- 📊 **Progress updates** every few minutes
- ⏱️ **Time estimates** for remaining training
- 🔄 **Model-by-model** completion status

---

## 🎯 **Production Usage After Training**

### **Load Trained Model:**
```python
import joblib

# Load the complete deployment package
deployment_info = joblib.load('enhanced_deployment_info.joblib')
best_model = joblib.load('enhanced_best_model_Logistic_Regression.joblib')
scaler = joblib.load('enhanced_scaler.joblib')
feature_columns = joblib.load('enhanced_feature_columns.joblib')

# Make predictions on new data
predictions = best_model.predict(scaler.transform(new_features))
```
